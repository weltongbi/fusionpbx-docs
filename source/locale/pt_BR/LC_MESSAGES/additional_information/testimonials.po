"*I've been a longtime VoIP enthusiast for years, since 2005, and I have "
"tried several different hosted/self-hosted PBX systems. Honestly, "
"FusionPBX wins hands down. What makes it even more amazing is the passion"
" that the FusionPBX developers and contributors have in their software. I"
" honestly couldn't be happier with a turn-key PBX system.*"

"I would like to tell everyone there that I have been trying to get an "
"open source PBX to work for me for over three months now and since I am "
"not a linux guy, I havenâ€™t been able to get any of them working the way I"
" wanted. FusionPBX installation script installed ALL required packages "
"and libraries in one go and it was up and running in 10 mins. Once I "
"followed the `youtube videos <https://www.youtube.com/fusionpbx>`_ it "
"took me no time to setup and migrate my clients to FusionPBX. One of the "
"best features I love in FusionPBX is the automatic dialplan expression as"
" I have always struggled with remembering the expression syntax. The user"
" interface and the way all the features are grouped is awesome."

"I just did my first install of FusionPBX a few days ago. All my prior "
"background has been in the Asterisk/FreePBX community. But my "
"introduction to the freeSWITCH/FusionPBX community has been a very "
"pleasant one. The change does include a small learning curve, but the "
"advantages far out way the effort required to learn the new platform. "
"Suddenly a lot of prior headaches and work arounds are gone. The install "
"is painless and simple compared to FreePBX. And after it is installed it "
"works! This is especially note worthy if you are used to trying to get "
"everything working with FreePBX on a VPS. This worked perfect on a VPS."

"Now for the more practical end of things. I found the features and "
"functionality of FusionPBX to be very comprehensive. The monitoring and "
"control you have over active calls is second to none. And unlike most "
"GUI's you do not need to sacrifice functionality for the use of a GUI. "
"With the dial plan manager you can easily add almost any custom dial plan"
" that you could by editing the xml directly. And as if that is not "
"enough, there is a built in editor for all the xml and config files."

"I came from a Trixbox background. I had experienced limitations with the "
"Trixbox solution and was looking for an alternative when I found "
"FusionPBX. The first thing that amazed me was how simple and speedy it "
"was to get a working phone system up and running with FusionPBX - far "
"simpler than Trixbox. But then I started to discover how much advanced "
"functionality was also available, and how extensible the design is - in "
"my opinion it is far easier to script for FusionPBX than to script for "
"Trixbox if you want to add additional functionality of your own. "
"FusionPBX is clearly a well thought through design, built on a very solid"
" underlying soft switch (FreeSWITCH) - for me that makes it the system of"
" choice."
