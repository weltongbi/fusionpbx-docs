msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Post Dial Delay (PDD) is experienced by the sender as the time from the "
"sending of the final dialed digit to the point at which the sender hears "
"ring tone or other in-band information. In other words, the PDD would be "
"the time from when the sender sends the INVITE to receiving the first "
"ringing response."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/applications/call_detail_record.rst:39
msgid ""
"That said, PDD does not take into account the time it takes the receiver "
"to hear the call coming in due to the various factors on how they are "
"setup for inbound calls. For example, call forwarding may affect the time"
" it takes the receiver to know that someone is calling because of call "
"forwarding. The sender might hear a ring tone almost instantly from the "
"time it dials the final digit because they sent out an INVITE, but the "
"receiver of the call might have setup inbound calls to be forwarded to "
"their cell phone, in which now the call must travel through their phone "
"system, to their phone system's gateway carrier to deliver the sender's "
"call to the receiver's cell phone carrier network in order for the cell "
"phone carrier to deliver the sender's call to the receiver's cell phone."
