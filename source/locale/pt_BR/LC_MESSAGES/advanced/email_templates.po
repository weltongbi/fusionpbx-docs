"Email Templates provide an easy way to make custom notification emails "
"for voicemail, voicemail transcription and missed calls.  The default "
"format is set for html.  The other option would be for text.  This "
"flexability will allow you to choose which suits you best.  If you choose"
" text, you will have to change the **enabled** filed to true for text in "
"each category.  Once those are changed, you will need to change html to "
"false."
