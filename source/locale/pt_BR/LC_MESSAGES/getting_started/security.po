"Similar to medieval fortifications it is recommended to provide your "
"servers with multiple layers of defenses. Be sure to use Firewalls, "
"Strong passwords, SSH, and make sure your servers are kept up to date for"
" all software being used. This includes the operating system, FreeSWITCH "
"and FusionPBX."

"SSL and TLS are very necessary in today's internet applications from VOIP"

"However you can use certificate providers where you can purchase "

"tenant wildcard certificates can be useful. Also when deciding on which "
"certificate provider to use you should look at the phones manufacturers "
"documentation to find one that is compatible HTTPS provisioning."
