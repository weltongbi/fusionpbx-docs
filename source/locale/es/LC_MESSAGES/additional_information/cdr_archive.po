"Fusionpbx has the ability to access CDR records on a seperate archive "
"database. This is helpful for longterm CDR storage while keeping your "
"active database small. When the feature is enabled you will see an "
"\"ARCHIVE\" button in CDR page that accesses records on your archive "
"database."

"The first step is to install an archive database. This can be done by "
"standing up another fusionpbx server or by setting up a postgres server. "
"If postgres is installed by itself you will need to manage the indexes, "
"tables names and column names manually on the archive server. They need "
"to match the values on the live database."

"Once you get your archive database setup and can access both databases in"
" both directions (live <-> archive), you will need a mechanism to move "
"the CDR Records from the live database to the archive database. In this "
"example I have a complete fusionpbx install on the archive server. That "
"way I can use the fusionpbx web gui to explore the records and use the "
"Upgrade feature to keep the table & column names in sync."
