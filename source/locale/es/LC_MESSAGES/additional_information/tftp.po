"Several models of phone out there that still only use TFTP for "
"provisioning.  Even though they have reached end of life, some of the "
"popular ones are the Cisco 7960 and 7940. Also would need to add the TFTP"
" port to the server firewall but this should be allowed only to specific "
"IP addresses as TFTP has no security. Recommend to use TFTP only as a "
"last resort for phones that don't support HTTPS."
