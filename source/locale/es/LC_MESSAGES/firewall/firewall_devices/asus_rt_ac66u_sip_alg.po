"This guide was created for the ASUS RT-AC66U router with Firmware Version"
" 3.0.0.4.380_8120.  FusionPBX is in the cloud with a public IP, and the "
"ZyXEL USG60 router is at the customer’s location with the extensions "
"behind it.  The RT-AC66U is a “prosumer” grade router.  It has good "
"performance for the dollar and is a good choice for home offices."

"This part is a little confusing.  It seems that ASUS has either reversed "
"the meaning of SIP Passthrough or changed how it works over a few "
"firmware releases.  At any rate, if you have difficulties with Audio or "
"Registrations, you can try toggling this setting.  With these home-grade "
"routers you should perform a full reboot in order to clear the tables "
"before testing the phones."
