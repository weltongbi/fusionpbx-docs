"with a *code as *30.  Kept the context as is with "
"`training.fusionpbx.com`_ . Status to show which mode. Made a pin number "
"to help secure the call flow. Made the detination label as Day Mode. "
"Picked a sound to familiarize which mode is activated. Choose a "
"destination for the alternative mode. Made the alternative detination "
"label as Night Mode. Picked an alternative sound to familiarize which "
"mode is activated. Choose a destination for the alternative mode. Finally"
